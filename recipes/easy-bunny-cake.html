        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Original recipe (1x) yields 12 servings (pieces)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) container vanilla frosting</li>
            <li>3 ¾ cups flaked coconut</li>
            <li>30 small jellybeans</li>
            <li>4 sticks red licorice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the sides
            and bottoms of two 9-inch metal springform pans.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>
            Beat cake mix, water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a large bowl with
            an electric mixer on low speed until moistened, about 30 seconds.
            Increase to medium speed and beat for 2 minutes. Pour into the
            prepared pans.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers
            comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes.
        </p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>
            Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then remove cakes from the
            springform pans and cool completely, about 20 more minutes.

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Place one cake on a serving tray, forming the bunny's head.</p>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>
            Cut 2 convex-shaped ears from each side of the second cake, and
            place them on each side of the head to form ears. Place the
            remaining concave-shaped piece about 1/2 inch below the head for the
            bowtie.

        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <p>
            Frost the entire bunny cake with vanilla frosting; pat the cup
            coconut evenly over top and sides. Decorate the bunny face and
            bowtie with jellybeans and use licorice to make whiskers.
